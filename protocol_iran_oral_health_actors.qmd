# Abstract

**Objective and aim:**

Despite of the classification in viewing oral health separately from the overall health, oral health affects overall health by causing pain and suffering (1). Oral diseases are among non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and associated with other NCDs like diabetes, cardiovascular disease and renal failure (2, 3). The national survey discovered that dental caries, periodontal diseases and tooth loss are growing compared with previous data. Caries-free rank is sharply declining from 12 to 15 years old (27%) and number of edentulous people is exceeding 50% in 65--74 years old age groups. These data indicate the urgent need for proper interventions in all age groups, especially in children . Only about 15.7% of the 5--6-year old children were caries free. So, about 84.3% of 5--6 year old children had unmet need (3).

Oral health system in Iran has its own complexity to make new policies because of stewardship weakness. The cooperation of education, primary health care, and other levels of health care system in the Iran Health Ministry is not satisfying. According
to Mohammadpour et. al report there are 7 main barriers against oral health policy making in Iran: executive and preventive challenges, educational and resource challenges, insurance, policy making and trusteeship challenges. Iranian policymakers and managers have to pay attention to the oral health implementation strategies to improve it at the national and regional level.
